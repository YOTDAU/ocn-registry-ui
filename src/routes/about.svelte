		This is an unofficial client for the 
		<a href="https://shareandcharge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OCN/overview">
			Open Charging Network</a>'s decentralized address book of participants, 
			also known as the
		<a href="https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-registry">OCN Registry</a>.
	</p>

	<p>There is no backend. You talk directly
		to the OCN Registry smart contracts; your private key is not stored 
		on a centralized system anywhere. 
	</p>

	<p>However, it is up to you to keep your private key secure. Right now
		the client does not support metamask but this is planned for the 
		future.
	</p>

	<p>Don't trust this deployment? If you prefer, you can 
		<a href="https://github.com/adamstaveley">check out the source</a> 
		and run it yourself.</p>
